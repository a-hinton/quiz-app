# Details
This site is a quiz created with vanilla JavaScript and styled in CSS.

# Technical Choices
I chose to store questions and answers as an array of key-value pairs. My game display function indexes into that array based on an incrementing index value.

Regarding design, I applied the display: none property to html elements that were not applicable to the active function. This meant I didn't need to actively generate html elements in JavaScript, but it made styling more complex because there were elements that were not displayed but still factored in positioning.

# Technical Issues
I was not able to get the number of correct answers to write to the HTML element. Also, my comparison statement does not function properly. Furthermore, I had difficulty in getting my CSS to look decent.
